## PROBLEM STATEMENT
* Creating a BMC for the company
* Designing a mind map
* Designing a Business Process Model with Bizagi
* Creating a business proto type with Pencil


## DESCRIPTION
This was a group project carried out by a team of four. The tools used for this project are Bizagi, X-mind and Pencil. This project helped me discover the importance of working in teams. A blockchain company known as FOTHPAY was the company in view where analysis was carried out. A Business Model Canvas was designed for the company. Then my team went on to develop a Business Modelling Process using Bizagi. We tried to take an overview of the problems encountered by FOTHPAY in her operations and we proffered solutions to them. The team used X-mind for mind mapping. On a last note we developed a proto-type for the business using Pencil.
